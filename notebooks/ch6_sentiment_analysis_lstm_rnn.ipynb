      "<START> the time i wasted seeing this movie i demand back i felt sick afterward but not because it touched me in any way it's pretentious trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved but i couldn't care less the characters are soulless and stupid you don't get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesn't leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation all of the students in the movie has issues but since you don't feel for them you don't believe their problems br br if i could write better in english i'd never stop but i can't so i'll stop now br br don't watch this\n",
